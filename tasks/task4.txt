Work out All the chapters in Part-1 of this basic text:

https://automatetheboringstuff.com/#toc

(This  book uses Python 3; you can get Python3 on your machine simply
by typing "python3" instead of  "python").

Time: 3-4 days should be enough.
--------------------------------------------------------


There are two versions of Python - 2 and 3. It will be good if you
can try out all the code you write under both Python 2 and  
Python 3; there are many places where you will get different
behaviour between the versions.

Python2 is still used very widely in the industry; but it
is preferred that new development be done in Python 3.

---------------------------------------------------------


a) When working out text-books, please put up all the sample 
code/exercise solutions in a git repo, properly organized by 
individual chapter (or section, whatever).

b) Do NOT put up exercise solutions of the MOOC's you are doing 
on github; making solutions publically visible is against 
course rules. A suggestion is to create an account on:

https://about.gitlab.com/gitlab-com/

I haven't used it personally, but they are fast  becoming a competitor 
for github.  I believe gitlab lets you create  "private" repositories. 
You can put  up MOOC exercise solutions in a private
repo on gitlab.
